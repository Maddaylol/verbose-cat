- ## Colour Theory
- 
| Feature    | Hue | Tint | Tone | Shade |
| ---------- | --- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Definition | The pure color | Hue + White | Hue + Gray | Hue + Black |
| Effect     | The base color identity | Lighter version of the hue | Muted or less saturated version of hue | Darker version of the hue |
| Saturation | Typically high (pure color) | Lower | Lower | Can be lower |
| Lightness  | Can vary depending on the pure hue | Increased                       | Can be similar to the base hue         | Decreased                           |
| Addition   | Nothing added                      | White                           | Gray (Black + White)                   | Black                               |
| Examples   | Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Violet   | Pink, Sky Blue, Lavender, Peach | Dusty Rose, Olive, Teal, Mauve         | Maroon, Navy, Forest Green, Mustard |
- ## In Material Theme
	- ### The Five Baseline Colours (Hues at the Core)**
		- **Primary:** This is your brand's main color. It's a specific **hue**.
		- **Secondary:** An accent color. A different **hue**.
		- **Tertiary:** Another accent color (can be more neutral). A third **hue**.
		- **Neutral:** Grays and off-whites. Technically hues (achromatic), but we'll deal with their variations.
		- **Neutral Variant:** Slightly different grays.
	- ### Material Theme Creating Variations (Tints, Shades, Tones), For each of your baseline colors (primary, secondary, tertiary, and the neutrals), the tools generate a range of:
		- **Tints:** Lighter versions (adding white).
		- **Shades:** Darker versions (adding black).
		- **Tones:** Variations in intensity (adding gray).
- ## In Android app project
	- ### Colour Scheme
		- `ColorScheme` holds all the generated colour variations, we can use [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) to generate the colour theme files we need in development
		- #### Take a closer look at the colour theme
			```Kotlin
			//a light color scheme generated by M3 builder
			private val lightScheme = lightColorScheme(  
				//primary related, the prominent UI
			    primary = primaryLight,  
			    onPrimary = onPrimaryLight,  
			    primaryContainer = primaryContainerLight,  
			    onPrimaryContainer = onPrimaryContainerLight,  
			    
			    //secondary related, less prominent UI, but still important
			    secondary = secondaryLight,  
			    onSecondary = onSecondaryLight,  
			    secondaryContainer = secondaryContainerLight,  
			    onSecondaryContainer = onSecondaryContainerLight,
			    
			    //tertiary related, balance the primary and secondary elements
			    tertiary = tertiaryLight,  
			    onTertiary = onTertiaryLight,  
			    tertiaryContainer = tertiaryContainerLight,  
			    onTertiaryContainer = onTertiaryContainerLight,  
			    
			    //error related, for validation
			    error = errorLight,  
			    onError = onErrorLight,  
			    errorContainer = errorContainerLight,  
				onErrorContainer = onErrorContainerLight,
				    
			    //background related, the bottom color of app
			    background = backgroundLight,  
			    onBackground = onBackgroundLight, 
			    
				//surface related, the one on the top of bottom app content, like a diaoig
			    surface = surfaceLight,  
			    onSurface = onSurfaceLight,  
		    
			    //surface related but less prominent
			    surfaceVariant = surfaceVariantLight,  
			    onSurfaceVariant = onSurfaceVariantLight,  
		    
			    //for border 
			    outline = outlineLight,  
			    outlineVariant = outlineVariantLight,  
			    
			    //semi transparent color for obsecure
			    scrim = scrimLight,  
			    
				//inverse color serves as three functions: 1. contrast 2. draw attention 3. indicate a change
			    inverseSurface = inverseSurfaceLight,  
			    inverseOnSurface = inverseOnSurfaceLight,  
			    inversePrimary = inversePrimaryLight,  

				//for surface container, the content above the basic app content, such as dialog
			    surfaceDim = surfaceDimLight,  
			    surfaceBright = surfaceBrightLight,  
			    surfaceContainerLowest = surfaceContainerLowestLight,  
			    surfaceContainerLow = surfaceContainerLowLight,  
			    surfaceContainer = surfaceContainerLight,  
			    surfaceContainerHigh = surfaceContainerHighLight,  
			    surfaceContainerHighest = surfaceContainerHighestLight,  
			)
			```
			- These colors are acutually defined in the `PaletteTokens`, and `PaletteTokens` has the raw tones, then they are categorized into different `ColorScheme`
				- `PaletteTokens` (raw colors) -> `ColorLightTokens`/`ColorDarkTokens` (mapping to UI roles) -> `ColorScheme` (accessible in UI code)
		- #### Dynamic color scheme
			- From A12, Android support scheme from user's wallpaper for personalization.
				- SDK34 (`chroma 4`)
					- `ColorResourceHelper.getColor(android.R.color...)` -> `dynamicDarkColorScheme` which is a `ColorScheme`
				- below(`chroma 8`)
					- use `TonalPalette` for less grey tones (`chroma 8`) for the colour scheme
	- ### Typography
		- `typograpgy` is combination of content types and sizes, defined in `Type.kt`
			- content types
				- display, headline, title, body, and label
			- sizes
				-  large, medium, and small
			```Kotlin 
				// in Type.kt
				val labelMedium = TextStyle (       
					fontWeight = FontWeight.SemiBold,       
					fontSize = 12.sp,       
					lineHeight = 16.sp,       
					letterSpacing = 0.5.sp   
				)
				// ui/components
				Text(
				    text = "Demo Text",
				    style = MaterialTheme.typography.labelMedium
		        )
			```
	- ### [Shape](https://m3.material.io/styles/shape/shape-scale-tokens#b09934f1-1b0f-4ce4-ade6-4a1f138add6c)
		- `shapes` is how the UI element looks like, usually its corner, more details about  are under`ShapeKeyTokens.kt` 
		- when we develop, we can choose the default scheme, but we also can define it in `Shape.kt`
			```Kotlin
				//in Shape.kt
				val shapes = Shapes (   
					extraSmall = RoundedCornerShape(4.dp),   
					small = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp),   
					medium = RoundedCornerShape(16.dp),   
					large = RoundedCornerShape(24.dp),   
					extraLarge = RoundedCornerShape(32.dp))
			```
- ## Conclusion
	- We began by exploring core concepts in colour theory to understand how Material Design generates a palette. This foundation helped us make sense of how the color system is structured—starting from PaletteToken, mapped into roles via light/dark tokens, and finally accessed through ColorScheme. In addition to colour, we also covered how Typography and Shape tokens contribute to consistent UI design and how each is implemented in an Android project.
