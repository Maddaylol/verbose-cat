- ## Colour Theory

| Feature    | Hue                              | Tint                          | Tone                                  | Shade                          |
|------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Definition | The pure color                   | Hue + White                   | Hue + Gray                            | Hue + Black                    |
| Effect     | The base color identity          | Lighter version of the hue    | Muted or less saturated version of hue | Darker version of the hue      |
| Saturation | Typically high (pure color)      | Lower                         | Lower                                 | Can be lower                   |
| Lightness  | Can vary depending on the pure hue | Increased                    | Can be similar to the base hue        | Decreased                      |
| Addition   | Nothing added                    | White                         | Gray (Black + White)                  | Black                          |
| Examples   | Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Violet | Pink, Sky Blue, Lavender, Peach | Dusty Rose, Olive, Teal, Mauve       | Maroon, Navy, Forest Green, Mustard |

- ## In Material Theme
	- ### The Five Baseline Colours (Hues at the Core)
		- **Primary:** This is your brand's main color. It's a specific **hue**.
		- **Secondary:** An accent color. A different **hue**.
		- **Tertiary:** Another accent color (can be more neutral). A third **hue**.
		- **Neutral:** Grays and off-whites. Technically hues (achromatic), but we'll deal with their variations.
		- **Neutral Variant:** Slightly different grays.
	- ### Material Theme Creating Variations (Tints, Shades, Tones)
		- For each of your baseline colors (primary, secondary, tertiary, and the neutrals), the tools generate a range of:
			- **Tints:** Lighter versions (adding white).
			- **Shades:** Darker versions (adding black).
			- **Tones:** Variations in intensity (adding gray).
- ## In Android app project
	- `ColorScheme` holds all the generated colour variations, we can use [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) to generate the colour theme files we need in development
	- ### Take a closer look at the colour theme
	```Kotlin
	//a light color scheme generated by M3 builder
	private val lightScheme = lightColorScheme(  
		//primary related, the prominent UI
	    primary = primaryLight,  
	    onPrimary = onPrimaryLight,  
	    primaryContainer = primaryContainerLight,  
	    onPrimaryContainer = onPrimaryContainerLight,  
	    //secondary related, less prominent UI, but still important
	    secondary = secondaryLight,  
	    onSecondary = onSecondaryLight,  
	    secondaryContainer = secondaryContainerLight,  
	    onSecondaryContainer = onSecondaryContainerLight,
	    //tertiary related, balance the primary and secondary elements
	    tertiary = tertiaryLight,  
	    onTertiary = onTertiaryLight,  
	    tertiaryContainer = tertiaryContainerLight,  
	    onTertiaryContainer = onTertiaryContainerLight,  
	    //error related, for validation
	    error = errorLight,  
	    onError = onErrorLight,  
	    errorContainer = errorContainerLight,  
		    onErrorContainer = onErrorContainerLight,
	    //background related, the bottom color of app
	    background = backgroundLight,  
	    onBackground = onBackgroundLight, 
		//surface related, the one on the top of bottom app content, like a diaoig
	    surface = surfaceLight,  
	    onSurface = onSurfaceLight,  
	    //surface related but less prominent
	    surfaceVariant = surfaceVariantLight,  
	    onSurfaceVariant = onSurfaceVariantLight,  
	    //for border 
	    outline = outlineLight,  
	    outlineVariant = outlineVariantLight,  
	    //semi transparent color for obsecure
	    scrim = scrimLight,  
	    
		//inverse color serves as three functions: 1. contrast 2. draw attention 3. indicate a change
	    inverseSurface = inverseSurfaceLight,  
	    inverseOnSurface = inverseOnSurfaceLight,  
	    inversePrimary = inversePrimaryLight,  

		//for surface container, the content above the basic app content, such as dialog
	    surfaceDim = surfaceDimLight,  
	    surfaceBright = surfaceBrightLight,  
	    surfaceContainerLowest = surfaceContainerLowestLight,  
	    surfaceContainerLow = surfaceContainerLowLight,  
	    surfaceContainer = surfaceContainerLight,  
	    surfaceContainerHigh = surfaceContainerHighLight,  
	    surfaceContainerHighest = surfaceContainerHighestLight,  
	)
	```
- These colors are acutually defined in the `PaletteTokens`, and `PaletteTokens` has the raw tones, then they are categorized into different `ColorScheme`
	- `PaletteTokens` (raw colors) -> `ColorLightTokens`/`ColorDarkTokens` (mapping to UI roles) -> `ColorScheme` (accessible in UI code)
